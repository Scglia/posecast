I think this is a skill set you can also learn in-house, but as a consultant the path is more attuned to lend to this behavior. Using the RPG metaphor, this is the specialization in the skills tree.</li></ol></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/uhl/status/1433226910197116928?s=20">Uhl Albert noticed</a> that Yelp‚Äôs app icons on Android are better, dropping the Yelp label from the icon itself.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/derek_shirk/status/1432790335994806272?s=20">Derek Shirk asked about ‚ÄúBach‚Äôs contant‚Äù</a> ‚Äî easy typo to hear.

I think this is a skill set you can also learn in-house, but as a consultant the path is more attuned to lend to this behavior. Using the RPG metaphor, this is the specialization in the skills tree.</li></ol></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/uhl/status/1433226910197116928?s=20">Uhl Albert noticed</a> that Yelp‚Äôs app icons on Android are better, dropping the Yelp label from the icon itself.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/derek_shirk/status/1432790335994806272?s=20">Derek Shirk asked about ‚ÄúBach‚Äôs contant‚Äù</a> ‚Äî easy typo to hear.

Leading and trailing padding can be some step on your grid (like 16pt or 12pt).</li></ul></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Main Topic:</strong></h3><p>This week Marshall continues with part 2 of design tips and tricks!

      <title>380: Designing WhatsApp ft. Priyanka Kodikal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we catch up with Priyanka Kodikal, a design manager leading consumer design at WhatsApp. We talk all about her journey as a designer, and what it's like building WhatsApp. In The Sidebar, we answer a simple question: should designers learn Figma in 2020?</p><hr /><h3><strong>Latest VIP Patrons:</strong></h3><ul><li>Belinda Hui</li><li>Nuzi Barkatally</li><li>Eugene Fedorenko</li><li>Mike Griffin</li><li>UX Vietnam</li><li>Sam Carden</li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>The Sidebar:</strong></h3><p>The Sidebar is an exclusive weekly segment for our Patreon supporters. You can subscribe starting at $1 per month for access to full episodes going forward! Sign up at <a href="https://patreon.com/designdetails">https://patreon.com/designdetails</a>.</p><p>In this week's Sidebar, we answer a listener question from our Twitter DMs: <i>Would it be a good idea to begin transitioning to Figma as my primary design tool, or do you think it matters as long as I'm producing quality work and shipping features at my current job? Would learning Figma help future-proof me? I just need to be sold on the idea and I figure you two would have good insights as Figma users.</i></p><hr /><h3><strong>Follow up:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/divyatakart/status/1347131245684092928">Divya Tak tweeted</a>: <i>one of the things that I feel like why it's easier to praise someone who just does the work is because creative professionals have a myth that "doing the work" is enough. So we find it easier to praise those people. And I also think (this is a bit darker) but it's easier to be not threatened by someone who has 100 instagram followers but makes art everyday, vs someone who makes art once a week but each piece gets over a thousand likes.</i></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mknepprath/status/1347229752160116748">Michael Knepprath tweeted</a>: <i>the bit about your writing voice changing - I try to fight this every time and mostly fail every time, I think. I want my posts to feel like longform tweets!</i></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Interview:</strong></h3><p>This week we caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/pkodikal">Priyanka Kodikal</a>, a design manager leading consumer design at WhatsApp. Before WhatsApp, she was a designer at Facebook Groups and Ads, a product designer at Evernote, and spent the years before working in the non-profit sector.</p><p>In this interview we talk about Priyanka's path through companies and teams to eventually land at WhatsApp. We discuss the design culture of WhatsApp, how they build products for so many different kinds of people around the world, why WhatsApp looks the way it does, and so much more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pkodikal">Follow Priyanka on Twitter</a> and share a tweet if you enjoyed this episode!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4YsJt4rIOI">Jan Koum talks about the WhatsApp journey</a></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Cool Things:</strong></h3><ul><li>Brian shared <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>, a product development book by the team at Basecamp.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we catch up with Priyanka Kodikal, a design manager leading consumer design at WhatsApp. We talk all about her journey as a designer, and what it's like building WhatsApp. In The Sidebar, we answer a simple question: should designers learn Figma in 2020?</p><hr /><h3><strong>Latest VIP Patrons:</strong></h3><ul><li>Belinda Hui</li><li>Nuzi Barkatally</li><li>Eugene Fedorenko</li><li>Mike Griffin</li><li>UX Vietnam</li><li>Sam Carden</li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>The Sidebar:</strong></h3><p>The Sidebar is an exclusive weekly segment for our Patreon supporters.

Sign up at <a href="https://patreon.com/designdetails">https://patreon.com/designdetails</a>.</p><p>In this week's Sidebar, we answer a listener question from our Twitter DMs: <i>Would it be a good idea to begin transitioning to Figma as my primary design tool, or do you think it matters as long as I'm producing quality work and shipping features at my current job? Would learning Figma help future-proof me? I just need to be sold on the idea and I figure you two would have good insights as Figma users.</i></p><hr /><h3><strong>Follow up:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/divyatakart/status/1347131245684092928">Divya Tak tweeted</a>: <i>one of the things that I feel like why it's easier to praise someone who just does the work is because creative professionals have a myth that "doing the work" is enough. So we find it easier to praise those people. And I also think (this is a bit darker) but it's easier to be not threatened by someone who has 100 instagram followers but makes art everyday, vs someone who makes art once a week but each piece gets over a thousand likes.</i></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mknepprath/status/1347229752160116748">Michael Knepprath tweeted</a>: <i>the bit about your writing voice changing - I try to fight this every time and mostly fail every time, I think. I want my posts to feel like longform tweets!</i></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Interview:</strong></h3><p>This week we caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/pkodikal">Priyanka Kodikal</a>, a design manager leading consumer design at WhatsApp. Before WhatsApp, she was a designer at Facebook Groups and Ads, a product designer at Evernote, and spent the years before working in the non-profit sector.</p><p>In this interview we talk about Priyanka's path through companies and teams to eventually land at WhatsApp. We discuss the design culture of WhatsApp, how they build products for so many different kinds of people around the world, why WhatsApp looks the way it does, and so much more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pkodikal">Follow Priyanka on Twitter</a> and share a tweet if you enjoyed this episode!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4YsJt4rIOI">Jan Koum talks about the WhatsApp journey</a></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Cool Things:</strong></h3><ul><li>Brian shared <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>, a product development book by the team at Basecamp.

The myth suggests that all people use one hand to interact with their phones and so interfaces should be designed accordingly.

However, with devices getting bigger and heavier it seems like people use both hands for more complex, high-stakes tasks (buying something) and one hand for simple, low-stakes tasks (scrolling through a feed).

The myth suggests that all people use one hand to interact with their phones and so interfaces should be designed accordingly. This may have been true on the early smartphones which were smaller and where apps tended to be simpler. However, with devices getting bigger and heavier it seems like people use both hands for more complex, high-stakes tasks (buying something) and one hand for simple, low-stakes tasks (scrolling through a feed). Is this what you guys have found to be true? And is there any recent research around how people use their hands to interact with their phones?</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1927">Luke W. writes about designing for large screen smartphones</a>.</li><li>Read the Material spec for <a href="https://material.io/components/app-bars-bottom">bottom app bars</a>.</li><li><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> and <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> have great bottom oriented UIs.</li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Cool Things:</strong></h3><ul><li>Brian shared <a href="https://loom.com">Loom</a>, a fantastic little tool for quickly recording and sharing presentations to the cloud.<ul><li><a href="https://getkap.co">Kap</a> is still great.</li><li><a href="https://www.mmhmm.app">mmhmm looks neat, too</a>.</li><li>And we <3 <a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a></li></ul></li><li>Marshall shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-UOdK8-mIjxBQm_ot1T-Q">Cracking the Cryptic</a>, a YouTube channel that gets real nerdy about sudoku.

I know that being a designer is more than knowing how to use Figma, and I don't want to breed mediocrity in design.</i></p><p><i>Do you have any suggestions on getting people excited about design fundamentals and how to teach them? Or are the basics more something that you learn with time and practice?</i></p><ul><li><a href="https://lawsofux.com">Laws of UX</a></li><li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883">Abstract on Netflix</a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo.com/85040589">The Gap by Ira Glass</a></li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Cool Things:</strong></h3><ul><li>Brian shared <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=80036165">Schitt's Creek</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/Mannnnnnyx/status/1314277242172661760">recommendation from listener Manny Xu</a></li><li>Marshall shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7l9chXMljpUft67vw78qw">Sideways</a>, a YouTube channel that dissects the use of music in pop culture.

      <title>361: Building Things You Use</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we weigh the pros and cons of working on a product that you love to use every day. Is it really so bad to be your own power user? In The Sidebar, we discuss steps to take when exploring vague problem areas.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Golden Ratio Patrons:</strong></h3><p>Float is a resource management software for planning your team‚Äôs time across multiple projects. Companies like Buzzfeed and MetaLab both use Float to plan and track hundreds of projects more effectively.

You can subscribe starting at $1 per month for access to full episodes going forward! Sign up at <a href="https://patreon.com/designdetails">https://patreon.com/designdetails</a>.</p><p>In this week's Sidebar, we talk about how to begin exploring broad-space problem areas. How do you A/B test when the problem is too vague? What is the value of intuition and past experience? This, plus more!</p><hr /><h3><strong>Tweets:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/sankethhh/status/1297607354897195009">Sanketh shared</a> a work in progress website collecting all of our Cool Things from past episodes - <a href="https://cool-things-design-details.webflow.io">check it out</a>!</li></ul><hr /><h3><strong>Main Topic:</strong></h3><p>What are the pros and cons of working on a product you love?</p><ul><li>Pros<ul><li>It's fun and easy to get excited about the work.</li><li>You can feel like a user and encounter user problems.</li><li>It's easier to find bugs and inconsistencies.</li><li>Becoming a power user happens naturally over time.</li><li>It's often easier to stay at a company due to higher quality ‚Äúwork time‚Äù - there is potential for a higher quality of life overall. Work doesn‚Äôt feel like work, it‚Äôs play!</li><li>It becomes highly motivating to solve your own problems, or the problems of people you work with each day.</li></ul></li><li>Cons<ul><li>It can be easier to lose sight of problem areas, confusing flows, new user experience issues, and positioning/branding problems.</li><li>Power users can memorize and get used to awkward flows that would otherwise suck - it‚Äôs hard to identify and fix these.</li><li>It can make you stop liking the thing itself - it blends work and pleasure so that there‚Äôs less of a clear boundary.</li><li>Navel gazing: it's harder to see opportunities for order-of-magnitude improvements or innovations.

<h3><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/323">Karl asks</a>:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, and we‚Äôve all been there, you know what you‚Äôre doing is right. Let‚Äôs say, fighting for a darker blue to pass accessibility requirements or visualising data in a simplified graphic rather than a complex multi-dimensional graph, to appeal to a wider audience.

<h3><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some of ya'll <em>finally</em> shared your shameful early work - thank you! We love it.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ptrckmrx/status/1253281368013971456">Patrick Marx</a> shared some relatively new work from 2014.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/katarinablind/status/1252949808295424002">Katarina Blind</a> shared an early stage mock for a &quot;pirate Uber&quot; to request a ride from her brother. Smart.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/zainkho/status/1253045552364892160">Zain Khoja</a> shared his first Medium case study.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/keaton_taylor/status/1253658107512848386">Keaton Taylor</a> shared a live URL for some early work and, boy oh boy, is it fun.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/lucaslsf/status/1254424037046001666">Lucas Morales</a> also shared a live URL for some earlier work, complete with a splash page!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/bennett_kevin/status/1254363298046390272">Kevin Bennett</a> agreed with our thoughts on paper prototypes - there's a time and a place, and for this type of work, it's exceedingly rare.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/keaton_taylor/status/1253653532227571712">Keaton Taylor</a> also agreed with our thoughts on the overvalue placed on pixel perfection and originality - glad to hear it resonated!</li>

<h3><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/323">Karl asks</a>:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, and we‚Äôve all been there, you know what you‚Äôre doing is right. Let‚Äôs say, fighting for a darker blue to pass accessibility requirements or visualising data in a simplified graphic rather than a complex multi-dimensional graph, to appeal to a wider audience. You‚Äôve presented this with justification and examples or clear guideline recommendations (say a design system) but it‚Äôs ignored. How do you guys generally know when to back down and stop fighting for what you know to be right based your design experience, and bow to the Product Manager/Owner‚Äôs opinion even if it‚Äôs not steeped in fact?</li>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we introduce a new supporter-only show segment, The Sidebar. Each week we'll be sharing a story, pro-tip, shortcut, or design-related cool thing. Supporters on Patreon will hear the first story today!</p>

<h3><strong>The Sidebar:</strong></h3>
<p>We've been behind on Bonusland, and it's been a challenge for us to catch up. Additionally, we felt like bonus episodes were too infrequent and not compelling enough as a Patreon reward.</p>
<p>This week we're starting a new experiment to make the patron rewards much better. It's a new segment of every episode called The Sidebar. In The Sidebar we will be sharing a story, pro-tip, shortcut, or design-related tidbit.</p>
<p>In today's Sidebar, we talk about Marshall's 8-year anniversary at Google, and what it means to play the long game.</p>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/elvin_not_11/status/1251156245748187142">Elvin</a> was the only listener who shared screenshots of early work with us - and it was good work!</li>

<h3><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pawsys">Pawe≈Ç Sysiak</a> asks a hat-trick listener <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/315">question</a>:</li>
<li>&quot;What are the most valuable (and overlooked) skills for the entry-level designer and senior designer? The flip side of this question is also interesting. What skills are overvalued for junior and senior designers?&quot;
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a> is a great primer on how to ask better research questions.</li>
<li>We asked Twitter for ideas, too:</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/WeekendVisuals/status/1251241279960293376">T</a> says: &quot;Most valuable for entry: Taste, attention to details, ready to listen, motivation. Senior: ready to learn, adapt, question past experience and delegate&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Nathans_Tweets/status/1251208938030153728">Nathan Lindhal</a> says: &quot;Learning to communicate with stakeholders, peers, etc is an extremely valuable skill. But it would be unfair to expect this from entry level position. But knowing the fundamentals (can this person do the work) and a commitment to improvement are underrated.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/TheOllieJT/status/1251207370971271168">Ollie</a> hit us with a thread:<br />
-  &quot;I think foundational design skills like typography hierarchy are underrated, whilst beautiful portfolios are overrated.&quot;<br />
-  &quot;I think it would be unfair to expect such strong communication skills from all entry-level designers, I think it is perhaps the most valuable skill.&quot;<br />
-  &quot;Communication as a skill can be a 'buzz word-y' so i'll specify. I think an entry-level designer that can join a team and comfortably question the status quo and speak out when they are unsure is a highly valuable trait.&quot;<br />
-  &quot;In my (limited) experience it takes the weight off of their supporting mid/senior designers. It's also an important component to entry-level designers learning on the job.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/emmalooney/status/1251205552094482435">Emma Gilbert</a> says: &quot;Most valuable: resourcefulness. There are unknowns at some point of every project. If a person can find momentum on their own by seeking out and not waiting for answers, that‚Äôs someone I want to work with.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jordankoschei/status/1251204844788080642">Jordan Koschei</a> says: &quot;The ability to communicate clearly verbally, through writing, and through visuals.

We try to look for indicators of taste and fundamentals, but ultimately have a good laugh about our early mocks. We'd love to see your early work too, so share it with us on Twitter this week!</p>

<h3><strong>Sharing our shame:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Last week Brian <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin/status/1249078284228292608">tweeted</a> his earliest web design work, found in the dregs of pixel hell. We learn that Brian had no taste, eyes, or sense of spacing in his early years. Ouch.</li>
<li><a href="https://dribbble.com/marshallbock">Marshall</a> digs into his portfolio on Dribbble, almost 10 years old now! And we don't hate everything here, it's clear that there was taste and an eye for the fundamentals.

<li>We still think there's something promising about this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/359673-Attach">attachments idea</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ATBGE/">/r/ATBGE</a> should provide you with some good laughs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brian's <a href="https://dribbble.com/brianlovin">Dribbble</a> started 5 years after the screenshots in the tweet, so they are <em>marginally</em> better.</li>

<h3><strong>Cool Things:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/233">kelle-yess</a> asks about giving upward feedback to senior designers, and how to deal with resulting pushback. Good questions abound. A tl;dl of our advice:

<li>Consider a matrix of the following

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a> is a useful way to approach a conversation with good intent and having the intention to learn along the way.</li>

<li>It's possible that you don't know everything about the situation, or the person you're giving feedback to is shielding you from unnecessary context.</li>
<li>Sometimes egos get in the way. But they're worth considering. Giving feedback in private, or in a way that lets your senior save-face, might be a better strategy and strengthen your relationship.</li>

      <title>332: Creating layouts: Design vs Implementation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we get deep into the weeds on creating layouts with Sketch's Smart Layout and Figma's Auto Layout, and compare the experience with implementing layouts in CSS and SwiftUI. This is a detailed exploration at the pros and cons of each toolset, and we try to find takeaways that can help us reconcile the wildly different mental models for each. As always, we share our cool things of this week including a content-blocking Safari extension and a novel about a cyberpunk future in which a trailer park girl and her cat decide the fate of humankind.</p>

<li>We reached our Patreon milestone of 128 supporters! This means we're kicking off the process of making Design Details merchandise. We need to figure out what we should make first, but we're leaning towards a torso-covering device of some kind, or perhaps a mug.</li>
<li>Ya'll helped us discover a great solitaire app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solitaere/id935572359">Solitaere</a>. It's about 95% of what Marshall needs, but still might not be enough to stop Marshall from building his own.</li>
<li>Something seems to have happened recently where we suddenly feel inundated with tweets and DMs from everyone ‚Äì it's so fun! We are reading everything, and will do our best to reply to as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Tweets:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Kayla_Brianne/status/1222240443171332101?s=20">Kayla Brianne</a> mentioned that our intros and followup sections can drag on a bit. We're going to be splitting up our chapters so that Tweets and Followup are discrete chapters.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AustinMRobinson/status/1222358279617228806?s=20">Austin Robinson</a> is baffled at how natural the show sounds, despite how much editing we do.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewmason/status/1222397793265799168?s=20">Andrew Mason</a> recommend that we use Descript for future editing ‚Äì we've both given it a brief try, but will continue exploring if it can make our editing process better.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelMacLeod1/status/1222435090246008833?s=20">Michael MacLeod</a> also knows what an &quot;um&quot; looks like.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/UdieChima/status/1222565589496946691?s=20">Udie Chima</a> agreed about the anxiety that can often come up when last minute changes come in while building a problem. It's not just you!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/thekevbot/status/1222681063912116224?s=20">Kevin Haag</a> came in hot as our 128th Patreon supporter. <a href="https://twitter.com/iloveprimes/status/1222690263421747200">Ruby Chen</a> was 127! <a href="https://twitter.com/jsonjun/status/1222708255618555904">Jason Jun</a> was number 100 ‚Äì a round number for normal people, but not for us!</li>

<h3><strong>Industry Talk:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sketch and Figma</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/features/smart-layout">Sketch Smart Layout</a> is powerful and flexible, but comes with tradeoffs of high setup time, and requires the use of symbols to add smart layout.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/">Figma Auto Layout</a> feels underpowered, but is a step in the right direction. The biggest miss is the lack of constraints support, but the flexibility of being able to add auto layout to any frame, not just components, makes it very fast to create lockups.</li>
<li>Both tools are relatively new, and have come a long way. We're ultimately happy with the few sets of use cases where Smart Layout and Auto Layout can save a designer a lot of time creating mocks. But we're concerned that both tools are built with entirely different mental models than code, making it challenging to move between design and development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CSS and SwiftUI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> is ridiculously flexible. This flexibility, unfortunately, means that developers get very few things for free. It takes a <em>lot</em> of built-up knowledge to understand the many ways to wrangle CSS into making something that is visually pleasing, accessible, and fast.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> is brand new and unfinished, leaving a lot of gaps in the toolset and documentation. That said, the primitives and opinionated defaults are incredibly simple, but allow for the creation of wildly complex application layouts.</li>
<li>Ultimately, both SwiftUI and CSS are designed to provide designers and developers with a structured set of primitives that will allow for the creation of complex and dynamic user interfaces. These primitives come with a mental model is is dramatically different from what is given to designers in Figma and Sketch.</li>

<h3><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We reached our Patreon milestone of 128 supporters! This means we're kicking off the process of making Design Details merchandise. We need to figure out what we should make first, but we're leaning towards a torso-covering device of some kind, or perhaps a mug.</li>
<li>Ya'll helped us discover a great solitaire app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solitaere/id935572359">Solitaere</a>. It's about 95% of what Marshall needs, but still might not be enough to stop Marshall from building his own.</li>
<li>Something seems to have happened recently where we suddenly feel inundated with tweets and DMs from everyone ‚Äì it's so fun! We are reading everything, and will do our best to reply to as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Tweets:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Kayla_Brianne/status/1222240443171332101?s=20">Kayla Brianne</a> mentioned that our intros and followup sections can drag on a bit. We're going to be splitting up our chapters so that Tweets and Followup are discrete chapters.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AustinMRobinson/status/1222358279617228806?s=20">Austin Robinson</a> is baffled at how natural the show sounds, despite how much editing we do.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewmason/status/1222397793265799168?s=20">Andrew Mason</a> recommend that we use Descript for future editing ‚Äì we've both given it a brief try, but will continue exploring if it can make our editing process better.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelMacLeod1/status/1222435090246008833?s=20">Michael MacLeod</a> also knows what an &quot;um&quot; looks like.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/UdieChima/status/1222565589496946691?s=20">Udie Chima</a> agreed about the anxiety that can often come up when last minute changes come in while building a problem. It's not just you!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/thekevbot/status/1222681063912116224?s=20">Kevin Haag</a> came in hot as our 128th Patreon supporter. <a href="https://twitter.com/iloveprimes/status/1222690263421747200">Ruby Chen</a> was 127! <a href="https://twitter.com/jsonjun/status/1222708255618555904">Jason Jun</a> was number 100 ‚Äì a round number for normal people, but not for us!</li>

<h3><strong>Industry Talk:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sketch and Figma</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/features/smart-layout">Sketch Smart Layout</a> is powerful and flexible, but comes with tradeoffs of high setup time, and requires the use of symbols to add smart layout.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/">Figma Auto Layout</a> feels underpowered, but is a step in the right direction. The biggest miss is the lack of constraints support, but the flexibility of being able to add auto layout to any frame, not just components, makes it very fast to create lockups.</li>
<li>Both tools are relatively new, and have come a long way. We're ultimately happy with the few sets of use cases where Smart Layout and Auto Layout can save a designer a lot of time creating mocks. But we're concerned that both tools are built with entirely different mental models than code, making it challenging to move between design and development.</li>

<p><strong>CSS and SwiftUI</strong></p>

      <title>331: The Designer-Developer Handoff</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we answer two listener questions about designer-developer handoff. We dig into questions like: What does a good developer handoff look like? What information should it contain? What are systems to make the handoff more efficient for everyone involved? As always, we share our cool finds of the week, this time including a return of the 6-second video format and a useful language learning app.</p>

<p><em>I‚Äôve been working as a designer for a few years. I‚Äôve done some web design projects but never any true product design.

      <title>323: Designing Social Proof</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode we dive into the murky waters of designing social proof in social networks. From upvotes to view counts, reputation to badges, there are a wide array of tools and patterns at a designer's disposal to communicate quality and popularity. But these patterns each have their own drawbacks, tradeoffs, and vectors for abuse. We dig into these, and more. Plus, as always, we share our cool finds for the week, this time featuring a Figma plugin and a beautiful indie video game.</p>

<h3><strong>Industry talk:</strong></h3>
<p>This week we dive into the murky waters of designing for social proof: the inputs, signifiers, and patterns that help people determine what is &quot;popular&quot; online.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/instagram-hiding-likes-globally/index.html">experimenting with hiding like counts</a> which may have implications for <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/hiding-likes-on-instagram-could-change-influencer-marketing-for-the-better-marketers-say">influencer marketing</a>.</li>
<li>Facebook tried to capture more emotional nuance when they <a href="https://medium.com/facebook-design/reactions-not-everything-in-life-is-likable-5c403de72a3f">added reactions to the like button</a>.</li>
<li>In 2015, Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9661180/twitter-vine-favorite-fav-likes-hearts">killed favorites in favor of likes</a>.</li>
<li>On our <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/311543">episode with Pablo Stanley</a>, we discussed the potentially harmful impact of having a handful of things you create go viral.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow has a robust <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation">reputation system</a> that aims to provide an accurate representation of any given's persons contributions to the community.</li>
<li>Quora uses <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005507963-What-are-Credentials-on-Quora-">Credentials</a> to communicate the experiences and achievements of any given writer on the platform.</li>
<li>Basecamp uses a feature called <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/introducing-boosts-an-all-new-way-to-show-your-support-in-basecamp/">Boosts</a> to help people provide higher fidelity feedback than a like button can offer. Brian misspoke and called this feature &quot;kudos.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>One Cool Thing:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Brian shared the <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/769588393361258724/Vectary-3D">Vectary Figma Plugin</a> which helps you apply your designs to 3-dimensional product mockups. Its <em>very</em> cool.</li>

<h3><strong>Industry talk:</strong></h3>
<p>This week we dive into the murky waters of designing for social proof: the inputs, signifiers, and patterns that help people determine what is &quot;popular&quot; online.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/instagram-hiding-likes-globally/index.html">experimenting with hiding like counts</a> which may have implications for <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/hiding-likes-on-instagram-could-change-influencer-marketing-for-the-better-marketers-say">influencer marketing</a>.</li>
<li>Facebook tried to capture more emotional nuance when they <a href="https://medium.com/facebook-design/reactions-not-everything-in-life-is-likable-5c403de72a3f">added reactions to the like button</a>.</li>
<li>In 2015, Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9661180/twitter-vine-favorite-fav-likes-hearts">killed favorites in favor of likes</a>.</li>
<li>On our <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/311543">episode with Pablo Stanley</a>, we discussed the potentially harmful impact of having a handful of things you create go viral.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow has a robust <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation">reputation system</a> that aims to provide an accurate representation of any given's persons contributions to the community.</li>
<li>Quora uses <a href="https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005507963-What-are-Credentials-on-Quora-">Credentials</a> to communicate the experiences and achievements of any given writer on the platform.</li>
<li>Basecamp uses a feature called <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/introducing-boosts-an-all-new-way-to-show-your-support-in-basecamp/">Boosts</a> to help people provide higher fidelity feedback than a like button can offer. Brian misspoke and called this feature &quot;kudos.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>One Cool Thing:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Brian shared the <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/769588393361258724/Vectary-3D">Vectary Figma Plugin</a> which helps you apply your designs to 3-dimensional product mockups. Its <em>very</em> cool.</li>

<h3><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Q: <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/67">Mannnny asks</a>, &quot;What's the best onboarding experience?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: <em>&quot;Before you even get to onboarding, you should think about your marketing site and your App/Play Store video and screenshots, because that's how a lot of users will first learn about your app. For the video, pack the first few seconds with a good hook, and make sure it works without sound, since these videos are muted by default. Once the user is in your app, consider the barrier to entry that any sign-in flow will present; using Oauth or a phone number is a great way to streamline sign-in, but you may want to allow users to play around in a signed-out state until they try to do something that actually requires signing in. Please don't ask for device permissions without priming the user for which permissions you'll need to access, why you need to access them, and what the user needs to do to enable them. Once you're ready to do some real user education, the easy (and probably wrong) thing to do is to have a paginated series of feature explanations, but you should never expect anyone to read those. No one reads. Instead, we prefer onboarding experiences that either 1) abstract the interface in a way that allows users to learn without the risk of experimenting on their own data, or 2) use their own interface to teach you how to use the interface. So meta. The most important thing to remember is that you only get one shot at a first impression, so make sure you're putting in the work to make that first run experience as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grokkable</a> as possible.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855">Todoist</a> utilizes app previews that that span multiple screenshots</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828">Reddit</a> prompts you for permissions immediately, but you can still use the app signed out</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id493136154">Clear Todos</a> (despite having a paginated onboarding flow) starts users with a sample list full of tasks that describe all the gestures in the app</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailbox_(application)">Mailbox</a> used abstraction and task-completion to educate users without the risk of experimenting on their own data</li>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> provides users with a pre-populated document that itself shows user how to start documenting</li>
<li><a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a> includes a sample podcast project that, using a podcast format and its own interface, walks users through how to navigate and edit the sample project</li>
<li><a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman</a> has a white glove service where a human on the phone personally walks you through how to use the app</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.useronboard.com/">User Onboard</a> is an outstanding resource for thoroughly detailed analyses of onboarding flows in many different apps and services</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Q: <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/67">Mannnny asks</a>, &quot;What's the best onboarding experience?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: <em>&quot;Before you even get to onboarding, you should think about your marketing site and your App/Play Store video and screenshots, because that's how a lot of users will first learn about your app. For the video, pack the first few seconds with a good hook, and make sure it works without sound, since these videos are muted by default. Once the user is in your app, consider the barrier to entry that any sign-in flow will present; using Oauth or a phone number is a great way to streamline sign-in, but you may want to allow users to play around in a signed-out state until they try to do something that actually requires signing in. Please don't ask for device permissions without priming the user for which permissions you'll need to access, why you need to access them, and what the user needs to do to enable them. Once you're ready to do some real user education, the easy (and probably wrong) thing to do is to have a paginated series of feature explanations, but you should never expect anyone to read those. No one reads. Instead, we prefer onboarding experiences that either 1) abstract the interface in a way that allows users to learn without the risk of experimenting on their own data, or 2) use their own interface to teach you how to use the interface. So meta. The most important thing to remember is that you only get one shot at a first impression, so make sure you're putting in the work to make that first run experience as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grokkable</a> as possible.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855">Todoist</a> utilizes app previews that that span multiple screenshots</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reddit/id1064216828">Reddit</a> prompts you for permissions immediately, but you can still use the app signed out</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id493136154">Clear Todos</a> (despite having a paginated onboarding flow) starts users with a sample list full of tasks that describe all the gestures in the app</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailbox_(application)">Mailbox</a> used abstraction and task-completion to educate users without the risk of experimenting on their own data</li>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> provides users with a pre-populated document that itself shows user how to start documenting</li>
<li><a href="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a> includes a sample podcast project that, using a podcast format and its own interface, walks users through how to navigate and edit the sample project</li>
<li><a href="https://superhuman.com">Superhuman</a> has a white glove service where a human on the phone personally walks you through how to use the app</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.useronboard.com/">User Onboard</a> is an outstanding resource for thoroughly detailed analyses of onboarding flows in many different apps and services</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>One Cool Thing:</strong></h3>

</ul>
</li>

<h3><strong>Listener Questions:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/17">Brandon Weiss asks</a>, &quot;Why are product teams comprised of people who have to work cross-functionally but aren't cross-functional themselves?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: <em>The quick answer is &quot;unicorns&quot; like that are pretty rare, hence the moniker. The structure and size of a company might determine what roles are needed when that company hires, so while cross-functional employees are super valuable in startups, they aren't necessarily preferable in larger organizations. Ultimately, you'll probably get the best return on your time investment by learning enough about each of your cross-functional partners' duties that you can speak their language, even if you can't do their job.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a Twitter thread unrelated to this podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/lily_dart/status/1181998097049755648">Lily Dart asks</a> design leaders, &quot;Do you get given a hard time for not being 'hands-on' anymore? Does it make you less of a designer?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: <em>First off, no one should give you a hard time for being hands-off. That's just mean and unprofessional. Secondly, Being a Head or Chief or Manager doesn't make you less of a designer, it just makes you something different than the traditional definition of &quot;designer.&quot; But that's okay! Your background as a designer helps you do your new role better, and while you should keep your finger on the pulse of the wider design world, no one expects you to sweat about pixels, and actually, that probably wouldn't be the most valuable use of your time. So ultimately, designers whose careers evolve to a leadership position are better off for having been a designer, for sure, but once the role changes, so too should the label.</em></li>

      <title>315: Building a Listener-Supported Podcast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode, we discuss the next evolution of Design Details towards becoming a fully listener-supported podcast. We share some background on the decision, our goals, and what's in it for you dear listener, if you are able to support this podcast. All this, plus follow up, a bit of news, and our weekly cool things as always.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We'll be digging into the Apple event + Android 10 later - we extra promise.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>News:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Brian <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin/status/1174324181581946880">found a buck-wild product launch video</a> for a product called <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a>.
<ul>
<li>The video reminded Marshall of <a href="http://adamlisagor.com/">Adam Lisagor</a> from <a href="https://sandwichvideo.com">Sandwich Video</a>. Adam replied <a href="https://twitter.com/marshallbock/status/1174339325351215105">in the comments</a>.</li>
<li>The video appears to have been made by <a href="https://twitter.com/czeins">Claude Zeins</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin_lebeau">Benjamin Lebeau</a>.</li>
<li>Overdub reminded us of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpH0CKltc73e4wh0_pgL3g/">Ctrl Shift Face</a>, a crazy YouTube channel that deep fakes videos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Listener Question Followup:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>From our conversation in episode 313 about <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/308247">effective ways of finding a job</a>, we received a <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/6">follow-up comment</a> about the value of cold applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/7">Nikita Voloboev</a> followed up on their question from the same episode about <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/308247">design process automation</a> with <a href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os">a repo for their macOS setup</a>: it is very, very thorough.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Becoming a listener-supported podcast:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We've been lucky to be able to work with so many amazing <a href="https://spec.fm/sponsors">sponsors</a> on Design Details in the past five years.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahberus">Sarah Marie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/luperdev">Drew Luper</a> produce and edit our show - they make us sound infinitely better every week.</li>
<li>Design Details is a part of the <a href="https://spec.fm/">Spec Network</a>, a podcast network for designers and developers.</li>
<li>We're moving to a lister-supported model, powered by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/designdetails">Patreon</a>. If you've enjoyed this show, found value, or entertainment, we would be eternally grateful for your support.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLFAXvFYhsE">I'm Bane, yes, that's my name</a>.</li>
<li>After our costs are covered, 10% of everything you pledge will be passed through to charities which help underrepresented minorities to learn about design (like <a href="https://girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a>).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>One Cool Thing:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>News:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Brian <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin/status/1174324181581946880">found a buck-wild product launch video</a> for a product called <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a>.
<ul>
<li>The video reminded Marshall of <a href="http://adamlisagor.com/">Adam Lisagor</a> from <a href="https://sandwichvideo.com">Sandwich Video</a>. Adam replied <a href="https://twitter.com/marshallbock/status/1174339325351215105">in the comments</a>.</li>
<li>The video appears to have been made by <a href="https://twitter.com/czeins">Claude Zeins</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin_lebeau">Benjamin Lebeau</a>.</li>
<li>Overdub reminded us of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpH0CKltc73e4wh0_pgL3g/">Ctrl Shift Face</a>, a crazy YouTube channel that deep fakes videos.</li>

<h3><strong>Listener Question Followup:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>From our conversation in episode 313 about <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/308247">effective ways of finding a job</a>, we received a <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/6">follow-up comment</a> about the value of cold applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/7">Nikita Voloboev</a> followed up on their question from the same episode about <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/308247">design process automation</a> with <a href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os">a repo for their macOS setup</a>: it is very, very thorough.</li>
</ul>

      <title>314: Beauty, Vulnerability, and Doing Things That Matter (feat. Haraldur Thorleifsson)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we catch up with Haraldur Thorleifsson, the founder, CEO, and social media intern at Ueno. In today's conversation, we cover everything from burnout to why designers should be thinking about solving more meaningful problems.

And as always, we share some cool things like a TV show, a book, and yet-to-be-released physical products.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we answer a couple listener questions‚Äîwhich design automation tools we use and how to efficiently look for a job‚Äîand rattle off a few things we'd like to see announced at the September Apple Event. And as always, we share a couple cool things like a 64-button mashup and a state-of-the-art mouse.</p>

<h3><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rafa and Kevin are back from summer vacation with a new episode of <a href="http://layout.fm/episodes/147">Layout</a>!</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Apple Event Preview:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Whoops!</em> Marshall goofed; the Micro LED screen was <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/07/22/apple-considering-micro-led-display-for-2020-apple-watch">rumored for the 2020 Apple Watch</a>, not the 2020 iPhone Pro</li>
<li>We've known for a while the iPhone 11 Pro would have <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/599036/2019-iphone-trio-3-camera-lenses-lens/">three cameras</a></li>
<li>It'd be cool to see <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3435416/report-details-of-apples-tile-like-item-trackers-revealed-from-internal-build-of-ios-13.html">Apple's Tile equivalent</a>
<ul>
<li>Article: <a href="https://www.economist.com/babbage/2012/07/13/youve-been-sherlocked">&quot;You've Been Sherlocked&quot;</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Listener Questions:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Q: <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/1">Sam Chang asks</a>, &quot;What are your thoughts on including project case studies on your website? Is it something you do only when you're actively looking for work?
<ul>
<li>Article: <a href="https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/">&quot;The Case Study Factory&quot;</a></li>
<li>Claudio Guglieri creates some <a href="https://guglieri.com/">amazing bespoke blog posts for his site</a></li>
<li>A: <em>&quot;If you'd like to show your thought process and/or let potential employers know that you understand the design process, yeah, totally. Or if you'd like to share with others a peek behind the scenes of the production, that's great, too. It's all useful from a documentation and lesson preservation standpoint. But in general, more seasoned designers tend to post fewer cast studies.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/2">Lucas Morales asks</a>, &quot;What can we do when fighting bureaucracy ends up taking the majority of our time at work? Should we continue to battle or just leave?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: <em>&quot;Maybe there's a third path. Given there isn't systemic mistrust throughout your org, you could try making an argument to overcome some of the red tape, framing it with the rationale of a better process, higher revenue, or whatever's most effective to move the stakeholder needle. This is a great chance to show your leadership by fixing a broken thing, and then you can take credit for it at your next performance review. Every obstacle is an opportunity! But ultimately, it depends. If the process is still salvageable, you might want to take the lead on salvaging it. If everything's hopeless, then yeah, maybe leaving is the best idea. If you do leave, though, make sure to mention your reasons for doing so in your exit interview, otherwise your concerns might never reach the right ears.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details/issues/3">Anonymous asks</a>, &quot;How would you describe a good product experience from a visual design perspective?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: <em>&quot;Visual design is most valuable when it exists in service to experience design. Strive to create a consistent narrative in the system through visual treatments, the goal being that your users can accurately understand the interface and consistently predict the result of any given action.&quot;</em></li>

      <title>310: Work, Culture, and Experimentation at a Product Design Agency (feat. Skyler Balbus)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In today's episode we catch up with Skyler Balbus, the Director of Product Design at Postlight. We dig into what it means to build products within the agency model, the decision to move from working in-house to working with clients, and how to build a culture where designers can experiment freely. Skyler also shares her ideas for how to build a strong design culture within an agency, tips for junior designers in the hiring process, and ways to build effective feedback loops within an organization. This, plus our weekly followup, news, and cool things!</p>

<h3><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We're trying a new experiment: ask your questions for us on <a href="https://github.com/specfm/design-details">GitHub</a> by opening a new issue. These issues will allow us to reply directly, keep a public backlog, and let the questions and answers be more readily searchable on Google!
<ul>
<li>You can create a GitHub account for free, in just a few minutes, in case you want to make a fake account for an anonymous question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Q: &quot;What advice do you have for a developer with no design experience getting started with design?&quot; ‚Äî<a href="https://twitter.com/DoleeYang">Dolee Yang</a>
<ul>
<li>A: &quot;Listen to <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/220880">our &quot;Principles of Design&quot; episode</a>, check out <a href="https://lawsofux.com">Laws of UX</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/994601867987619840">Refactoring UI</a>, then read the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines">Apple HIG</a> and/or the <a href="https://material.io/design">Material Guidelines</a>, paying attention to the thinking behind the systems. When in doubt, fall back to system defaults. But most importantly, get into the mindset of a designer and, as you use products in your daily life, start asking, 'Why did they do it like this?'&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: &quot;How do you reconcile icon systems between platforms? Do you have different icons for web, iOS, and Android? Or do you try to make them all consistent with a brand icon set?&quot; ‚ÄîAnonymous
<ul>
<li>A: &quot;Actually, both are valid strategies. If you use the default glyphs and styling for icons on each platform, you can have high confidence your users will understand them. If you have a strong brand identity, you can style those glyphs to fit in with your icon set. If you use unique glyphs, consider including labels to make their meaning clear to users who are only familiar with system glyphs.&quot;</li>

<h3><strong>Listener questions</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Q: &quot;Do designers ever make prototypes of entire apps, or is the process more about chunking out the main areas and adding as the product develops?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: &quot;Once your app structure becomes sufficiently complex, building everything into one prototype becomes less and less tenable. We prefer to focus each of our prototypes on one user journey. Even the most on-rails prototype can be an incredibly useful tool in user research studies.&quot;</li>
<li>For bigger stuff, we like <a href="https://www.framer.com/">Framer X</a>, which &quot;offers tools to design scroll, link and page interactions&quot;</li>
<li>For smaller stuff, we like <a href="https://principleformac.com/">Principle</a>, which &quot;makes it easy to design animated and interactive user interfaces&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: &quot;Is it better to be focused on one thing or multiple skills to have a better chance of promotion?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: &quot;A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills">T-shaped</a> (or maybe œÄ-shaped) generalist is usually a good choice, but in our experience, you can be successful regardless of which path you choose.&quot;</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: &quot;How do you guys get intentional about your growth as designers, and how are you able to measure that growth?&quot;
<ul>
<li>A: &quot;Get uncomfortable and try new things! Our best and fastest growth has come from tackling challenges outside our wheelhouses. It's almost always scary, but in the end, the satisfaction of growth outweighs the fear of the unknown.&quot;</li>

<h3><strong>Listener Questions:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Q: How do you align text boxes? To the grid? Or to the baseline grid?
<ul>
<li>A: A holistic baseline grid is an admirable aspiration, but it's rarely realistic. Just do your best, and pay attention through implementation for quality assurance. For the most part, we'd suggest you try using atomic-unit-sized leading (multiples of 4pt) and align to the grid or other objects' bounding boxes. That is, unless you have multiple single lines of text, like a list cell with a Label and Detail (such as in Settings), in which case, a baseline alignment is preferred.</li>
<li>Check out the Text Elements section of <a href="https://twitter.com/superbryntendo">Bryn Jackson</a>'s <a href="https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid">The 8-Point Grid</a> article for some more solid advice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: How do you think about organizations that use dark patterns when you're interviewing to work for them?
<ul>
<li>A: Maybe just ask? If you're uncomfortable asking directly, you could always abstract the question like, &quot;How much agency does the design team have in influencing legacy patterns?&quot;</li>
<li>Back in 2010, Facebook interrupted their account deletion flow with <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/12/18/facebook-will-miss-you">pictures of your friends who &quot;will miss you&quot;</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q: Do you think about your portfolio while you have a job? What if your company isn't great at or doesn't have resources for a particular process, like research?
<ul>
<li>A: Recognizing a shortcoming is the first step toward fixing it. Provide leadership where none exists! At the very least, you can use your performance reviews as a way to regularly collect your work.</li>
<li><a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a> is a book that helps you learn &quot;how to talk to customers and learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you&quot;</li>

<h3><strong>Reflecting on 300 episodes of Design Details</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Design Details was originally a <a href="https://brianlovin.com/design-details">blog</a>. The post for <a href="https://brianlovin.com/design-details/paper-facebook-ios">Facebook Paper</a> became popular and led to many more posts in the following months.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/superbryntendo">Bryn Jackson</a> and Brian co-hosted Design Details for 256 episodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details">The full Design Details archive</a> is available for all to hear! We have recommended starting episodes and you can search for the &quot;Best-of&quot; compilation episodes.</li>
<li>Early episodes, like Episode 3 with <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/7935">Wilson Miner</a> were critical for setting the tone of the show.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahberus">Sarah Marie</a>, and recently <a href="https://twitter.com/luperdev">Drew Luper</a>, have been editing and producing every episode of Design Details. The show wouldn't be possible without them, and their work is the reason our audio sounds <em>so</em> good. Thank you Sarah and Drew!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronmillerillz/status/1137443071996682241">Aaron Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jhuashao/status/1137441177840447488">Joshua Shao</a> asked how we keep the show going every week, and what it takes to pull off the weekly release schedule.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/eileenvvong/status/1137447360395481089">Eileen Wong</a> asked if there were ever times we wanted to give up, or what the low points were of recording Design Details.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/tommoor/status/1137455284291420160">Tom Moor</a> asked if any life-changing connections were made through the show.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/294941">Tea Chang</a>'s episode was great example of changing how Marshall thought about interviewing guests.</li>
<li><a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/11237">Episode 23</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisTauziet">Christophe Tauziet</a> helped Brian get his foot in the door at Facebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/leoyakxi/status/1137476089322692608">Leo</a> asked if we are planning on bringing back old guests to follow up on their progress as designers.
<ul>
<li>We like the idea of doing followup interviews similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm0MGnuRnH0">Vanity Fair's interview with Billie Eilish</a> recorded one year apart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Sudhan_89/status/1137458749558349825">Hari</a> asked what episodes we would recommend a new listener start with. Here are our top ten episodes (by download count):

<li>The new <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> is silly. The price of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/">Pro Display XDR</a> is even sillier.</li>
<li>Marshall is excited for too many things:
<ul>
<li>New <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/">semantic colors</a> that handle dark mode automatically.</li>
<li>iOS 13 will <a href="https://www.beingguru.com/2019/06/ios-13-will-block-spam-calls-for-you-from-unknown-numbers/">block spam calls automatically</a></li>
<li>iOS 13 gets a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/every-important-new-thing-ios-13-will-bring-your-iphone-this-fall/">native swipe keyboard</a>, years after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/googles-gboard-for-ios-combines-a-keyboard-with-google-search/">Gboard's implementation</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> is a new declarative way to build iOS applications. It is very exciting, indeed.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Reflecting on 300 episodes of Design Details</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Design Details was originally a <a href="https://brianlovin.com/design-details">blog</a>. The post for <a href="https://brianlovin.com/design-details/paper-facebook-ios">Facebook Paper</a> became popular and led to many more posts in the following months.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/superbryntendo">Bryn Jackson</a> and Brian co-hosted Design Details for 256 episodes.</li>
<li><a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details">The full Design Details archive</a> is available for all to hear! We have recommended starting episodes and you can search for the &quot;Best-of&quot; compilation episodes.</li>
<li>Early episodes, like Episode 3 with <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/7935">Wilson Miner</a> were critical for setting the tone of the show.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahberus">Sarah Marie</a>, and recently <a href="https://twitter.com/luperdev">Drew Luper</a>, have been editing and producing every episode of Design Details. The show wouldn't be possible without them, and their work is the reason our audio sounds <em>so</em> good. Thank you Sarah and Drew!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/aaronmillerillz/status/1137443071996682241">Aaron Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jhuashao/status/1137441177840447488">Joshua Shao</a> asked how we keep the show going every week, and what it takes to pull off the weekly release schedule.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/eileenvvong/status/1137447360395481089">Eileen Wong</a> asked if there were ever times we wanted to give up, or what the low points were of recording Design Details.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/tommoor/status/1137455284291420160">Tom Moor</a> asked if any life-changing connections were made through the show.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/294941">Tea Chang</a>'s episode was great example of changing how Marshall thought about interviewing guests.</li>
<li><a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/11237">Episode 23</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisTauziet">Christophe Tauziet</a> helped Brian get his foot in the door at Facebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/leoyakxi/status/1137476089322692608">Leo</a> asked if we are planning on bringing back old guests to follow up on their progress as designers.
<ul>
<li>We like the idea of doing followup interviews similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm0MGnuRnH0">Vanity Fair's interview with Billie Eilish</a> recorded one year apart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Sudhan_89/status/1137458749558349825">Hari</a> asked what episodes we would recommend a new listener start with. Here are our top ten episodes (by download count):

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we welcome to the show Linzi Berry, a manager on Lyft's design system. Linzi enlightens us on how to implement, maintain, enforce, evangelize, and roll out a design system, and we discuss her super informative design blog, Tap to Dismiss. In Follow-up, we debate some Episode 300 suggestions, revisit the Figma UI refresh, and shout out a quality-of-life improvement in Sketch 54. And as always, we (all three of us!) share some cool things, including a historic photo, a video to help understand that photo, and an update on the Bobiverse.</p>

      <title>289: Design File Hygiene</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Marshall offers a few simple tips for tidying up your source files, and we answer a listener question about when to move on from a company. In News, we shout out a new resource from the maker of Laws of UX. And as always, we share a couple cool things like a browser for neoworkers and an article about the Omnibox.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Last week, Marshall recommended the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-DiamondClean-Rechargeable-toothbrush/dp/B06XSH2RNQ">Philips Sonicare DiamondClean 9500 Electric Toothbrush</a></li>
<li>Brian doesn't think it's worth the money, unless you're into Mercedes-Benz, apparently</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>News:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://humanebydesign.com">Humane by Design</a> is &quot;a resource that provides guidance for designing ethically humane digital products through patterns focused on user well-being&quot;</li>
<li>It's made by <a href="https://jonyablonski.com/">Jon Yablonski</a>, who you might remember as the maker of <a href="https://lawsofux.com">Laws of UX</a> referenced in <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/220880">271: Principles of Design</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous has been at a startup for years and doesn't know where it's going. They ask, &quot;Should I stay and fight the good fight? Or should I go to a bigger company and make more money?&quot;</li>

<h4><strong>Industry Talk:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A few simple rules:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Rename and structure your layers as you create them</li>
<li>If you find yourself duplicating an element frequently, make it a symbol</li>
<li>Use &quot;Bounds&quot; layers to define a group's area, then snap groups together like Lego</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sketch Plugins:</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hrescak/Sketch-Layer-Tools">Layer Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ashung/Automate-Sketch">Automate</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bomberstudios/artboard-manager">Artboard Manager</a></li>

<li><a href="https://sketchrunner.com/">Runner</a></li>
<li>Here <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/2YlMA">the Sketch Cloud source file</a> for Marshall's unsolicited redesign of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/new-york-times-crossword/id307569751?mt=8">New York Times Crossword app on iOS</a></li>
<li>Importing <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/KDaTOwP4wEUcU5rwEiosqrfv/NYT-Crossword">the file into Figma</a> resulted in some unexpected insanity, but hopefully you can see through the mistranslations and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grok">grok</a> the structure. Sorry :(</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Marshall offers a few simple tips for tidying up your source files, and we answer a listener question about when to move on from a company. In News, we shout out a new resource from the maker of Laws of UX. And as always, we share a couple cool things like a browser for neoworkers and an article about the Omnibox.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Last week, Marshall recommended the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-DiamondClean-Rechargeable-toothbrush/dp/B06XSH2RNQ">Philips Sonicare DiamondClean 9500 Electric Toothbrush</a></li>
<li>Brian doesn't think it's worth the money, unless you're into Mercedes-Benz, apparently</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>News:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://humanebydesign.com">Humane by Design</a> is &quot;a resource that provides guidance for designing ethically humane digital products through patterns focused on user well-being&quot;</li>
<li>It's made by <a href="https://jonyablonski.com/">Jon Yablonski</a>, who you might remember as the maker of <a href="https://lawsofux.com">Laws of UX</a> referenced in <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/220880">271: Principles of Design</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Listener Question:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous has been at a startup for years and doesn't know where it's going. They ask, &quot;Should I stay and fight the good fight? Or should I go to a bigger company and make more money?&quot;</li>

<h4><strong>Industry Talk:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A few simple rules:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Rename and structure your layers as you create them</li>
<li>If you find yourself duplicating an element frequently, make it a symbol</li>
<li>Use &quot;Bounds&quot; layers to define a group's area, then snap groups together like Lego</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sketch Plugins:</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hrescak/Sketch-Layer-Tools">Layer Tools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ashung/Automate-Sketch">Automate</a></li>

<li>Here <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/2YlMA">the Sketch Cloud source file</a> for Marshall's unsolicited redesign of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/new-york-times-crossword/id307569751?mt=8">New York Times Crossword app on iOS</a></li>
<li>Importing <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/KDaTOwP4wEUcU5rwEiosqrfv/NYT-Crossword">the file into Figma</a> resulted in some unexpected insanity, but hopefully you can see through the mistranslations and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grok">grok</a> the structure.

In Follow-up, we hear back about our Spectre critique from last episode, and we discover listeners <em>do</em> listen until the end.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we discuss spoken accents, answer a listener question about salary negotiations, and Marshall dives deep into the design of Apex Legends. And as always, we share a couple cool things, like a hip hop musical and a way to bring joy back to your Twitter timeline.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Intro:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/JakMccormack/status/1098940900657500160">Jak McCormack</a> wants us to attempt English accents. No thank you, Jak üòú
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZUoCpx8jag">&quot;That's bait&quot;</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AS_Osipov/status/1097391312008036355">Anton Osipov</a> shared a helpful visual for using a unit-based vertical baseline.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/zainkho">Zain Khoja</a> shared <a href="https://medium.com/students-who-design">studentswho.design</a>, a podcast bridging the gap between students and the design industry - by students, for students.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Listener Questions:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>An anonymous listener asks: &quot;I‚Äôm about to change jobs and soon I‚Äôll have initial call with someone from one of the companies I could potentially work for. I don‚Äôt want to invest too much of my time in multiple calls and meetings with them before being sure the offer meets my expectations, especially in terms of salary. But I also don‚Äôt want to be considered as one of those guys who care only about money. So my question is: what‚Äôs the right moment to talk about this? Should that be something to talk about during the very first call? Or maybe later? For context: it was the company who reached out to me whether I‚Äôd be interested in the role.&quot;
<ul>
<li>HBR <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/02/people-want-3-things-from-work-but-most-companies-are-built-around-only-one">wrote</a> about what people want from their jobs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Explain Like I'm Five:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Marshall goes deep into the world of <a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/apex/apex">Apex Legends</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/charliedeets">Charlie Deets</a> explains <a href="https://medium.com/@charliedeets/nothing-to-say-c2edaf46fba5">the magic of communication</a> in Apex Legends</li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266308/">Battle Royale</a>, based on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Royale-Novel-Koushun-Takami/dp/1421527723">novel</a> by Koushun Takami, is a film from 2000 in which the Japanese government captures a class of ninth-grade students and forces them to kill each other under the revolutionary &quot;Battle Royale&quot; act</li>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn">Respawn Entertainment</a> is the company behind Apex Legends, who are well known for the <a href="https://www.titanfall.com/titanfall">Titanfall</a> series</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we discuss spoken accents, answer a listener question about salary negotiations, and Marshall dives deep into the design of Apex Legends. And as always, we share a couple cool things, like a hip hop musical and a way to bring joy back to your Twitter timeline.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Intro:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/JakMccormack/status/1098940900657500160">Jak McCormack</a> wants us to attempt English accents. No thank you, Jak üòú
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZUoCpx8jag">&quot;That's bait&quot;</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AS_Osipov/status/1097391312008036355">Anton Osipov</a> shared a helpful visual for using a unit-based vertical baseline.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/zainkho">Zain Khoja</a> shared <a href="https://medium.com/students-who-design">studentswho.design</a>, a podcast bridging the gap between students and the design industry - by students, for students.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Listener Questions:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>An anonymous listener asks: &quot;I‚Äôm about to change jobs and soon I‚Äôll have initial call with someone from one of the companies I could potentially work for. I don‚Äôt want to invest too much of my time in multiple calls and meetings with them before being sure the offer meets my expectations, especially in terms of salary. But I also don‚Äôt want to be considered as one of those guys who care only about money. So my question is: what‚Äôs the right moment to talk about this? Should that be something to talk about during the very first call? Or maybe later? For context: it was the company who reached out to me whether I‚Äôd be interested in the role.&quot;
<ul>
<li>HBR <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/02/people-want-3-things-from-work-but-most-companies-are-built-around-only-one">wrote</a> about what people want from their jobs.</li>

<h4><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>For last week's One Cool Thing, Marshall shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iylZD9RaYek">LG's 65-inch Rollable 4K OLED TV</a> (video), and go figure, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZO4RFBi_R0&amp;t=40">it actually DOES resize to 21:9</a> (video). Whoops!

<h4><strong>Listener Questions:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/andreas_hello">Andreas v.d. Griendt</a> asks &quot;How do you work with developers to get your 8pt grid designs implemented? This is easy for placing a button. But if you actually would align text to a 4pt baseline, this is very challenging. Easy to do in Sketch, but super difficult for developers to implement/understand. For web this would be even more difficult than for native. But dynamic font sizing can be a challenge as well with this approach. What is helpful to do? How do you balance enforcing this?&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/kevgski">Kevin Gutowski</a> asks &quot;Data is, of course, very important. How do you actually learn from the features that you ship? What hard metrics / soft metrics are recorded? How are they being recorded and by whom?&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>One Cool Thing:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Marshall shared <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627">Russian Doll</a>, a Netflix Original co-created by and starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005169/">Natasha Lyonne</a></li>

<h4><strong>Follow-up:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>For last week's One Cool Thing, Marshall shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iylZD9RaYek">LG's 65-inch Rollable 4K OLED TV</a> (video), and go figure, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZO4RFBi_R0&amp;t=40">it actually DOES resize to 21:9</a> (video). Whoops!
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mea-culpa"><em>Mea culpa</em></a> is a very fancy Latin phrase meaning &quot;my fault&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ramongilabert">Ramon Gilabert</a> suggested a couple secure ways of time-tracking and network control
<ul>
<li><a href="https://timingapp.com/">Timing</a> is &quot;the best automatic Mac time tracker for productive professionals and freelancers&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a> &quot;makes your Internet connections visible and puts you back in control&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>News:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/updates/#version-53">Sketch 53</a> is available now</li>
<li>Sketch Blog: <a href="https://blog.sketchapp.com/better-overrides-a-brand-new-fill-popover-and-faster-prototyping-in-sketch-53-160e6f760919">&quot;Better overrides, a brand new Fill Popover and faster prototyping in Sketch 53&quot;</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Listener Questions:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/andreas_hello">Andreas v.d. Griendt</a> asks &quot;How do you work with developers to get your 8pt grid designs implemented? This is easy for placing a button. But if you actually would align text to a 4pt baseline, this is very challenging. Easy to do in Sketch, but super difficult for developers to implement/understand. For web this would be even more difficult than for native. But dynamic font sizing can be a challenge as well with this approach. What is helpful to do? How do you balance enforcing this?&quot;</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/kevgski">Kevin Gutowski</a> asks &quot;Data is, of course, very important. How do you actually learn from the features that you ship? What hard metrics / soft metrics are recorded? How are they being recorded and by whom?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><strong>One Cool Thing:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Marshall shared <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627">Russian Doll</a>, a Netflix Original co-created by and starring <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005169/">Natasha Lyonne</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin/status/1094006145671356418">Brian shared</a> a <a href="https://github.com/brianlovin/security-checklist/pull/128">pull request</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/joachimesque">Jaochim</a> that makes <a href="https://securitycheckli.st/">Security Checklist</a> more accessible</li>

      <title>276: Hidden Shortcuts, Formal Educations, and &quot;Builders&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, we answer three listener questions: one about hidden shortcuts, one about the line between designer and developer, and one about the necessity of a design degree. And as always, we share a couple cool things, like a trailer a few people have seen and a channel that make videos about speedrun progressions.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Listener Questions</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/RaceSwisher">Race Swisher</a> says: &quot;You guys should talk about hidden shortcuts that can be super confusing for users.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Article: <a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/ios-12-keyboard-trick-non-3d-touch-iphone/">&quot;This iOS 12 Keyboard Trick for Non-3D Touch iPhone Users is Going Viral&quot;</a></li>
<li>iOS:
<ul>
<li>In the keyboard, 3D Touch anywhere on the keys to move your cursor freely
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gboard-the-google-keyboard/id1091700242">Gboard for iOS</a> has a phenomenal swipe-typing feature, in addition to many other nice little time-savers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the keyboard, drag from the 123 button to a key in the alternate keyboard, then release to return to the ABC keyboard</li>
<li>In the keyboard, long-press on keys for additional character options</li>
<li>In the iPad keyboard, drag the Dismiss Keyboard button to split and reposition the keys</li>
<li>In the keyboard, double-space for a period followed by a space</li>
<li>On the home screen, 3D Touch app icons for quick actions (in supported apps)</li>
<li>On iPhone X, swipe down on the Home Indicator to trigger Reachability (Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Reachability On)</li>
<li>In Tweetbot, two-finger swipe vertically to switch between Day/Night mode</li>
<li>In Google Maps, double-tap-and-drag vertically to zoom</li>
<li>In Spotify, swipe horizontally to go to the previous/next track</li>
<li>In Spotify, tap the Search tab a second time to bring up the keyboard and focus the Search field</li>
<li>In Spotify, long-press the Search tab to start a voice search</li>
<li>In Tweetbot, long-press-and-drag to reassign the last two tabs</li>
<li>In Safari, type in the address bar and scroll down the autocomplete suggestions to Find in Page</li>
<li>In Safari, long-press on the Refresh button to Request Desktop Site</li>
<li>In Safari, long-press on the Tabs icon to create a New Tab or Close All Tabs</li>
<li>In Control Center, 3D Touch-and-drag on certain platters for pre-defined options (Timer, Flashlight, Camera)</li>
<li>In Messages, 3D Touch on avatars in the list for quick actions (Call, FaceTime, Pay, Contact Details)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>macOS:
<ul>
<li>[Mojave] At any time, press Cmd+Shift+5 for more detailed screenshot options</li>
<li>At any time, press Cmd+Opt+Shift+3 or 4 to send the screenshot to your clipboard</li>
<li>At any time, press Cmd+Space for Spotlight</li>
<li>In a text field, press Cmd+Ctrl+Space for the Emoji picker, and type to search by emoji name</li>
<li>At any time, press Cmd+Tab to switch to your most recent app, or continue holding Cmd and press Tab again to move forward or ~ (or Shift+Tab) to move backward through the list</li>
<li>In applications with multiple windows, press Cmd+~ or Cmd+Shift+~ to navigate between windows</li>
<li>In Chrome, press Cmd+Opt+Left or Right (or Cmd+Shift+[ or ]) to navigate between open tabs (or Cmd+1 through 0 to jump straight to one of your first ten tabs)</li>
<li>In a text field, press Cmd+[ or ] to adjust the indentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Colin_Lees">Colin Lees</a> asks: &quot;What kind of design-related education do you (or your peers) tend to have? Is there a case for designers with no formal education at all?&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Our answer: Having a college degree, regardless of focus, can be a signal to employers that you're more likely to be a responsible, knowledgeable person, but it's not necessary to get a job, as long as you can show that you know your shit. And getting a degree in HCI or Interaction Design is a great way to gain knowledge and get a head-start on good processes, but again, it's unnecessary, as long as you've learned those same lessons on your own.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/samchangsucks">Sam Chang</a> asks: &quot;Something that's been on my mind lately is the overlap between a designer and a developer. I've noticed, for example, that Brian has taken on more of a developer role at Spectrum, and so I'm curious to hear if Brian sees himself as more of a designer or a developer, or maybe just a builder?&quot;
<ul>
<li><em>Our answer: Should designers code? Ultimately, having an understanding of what your developers do every day will help you to be a better designer, and vice versa. So learning how to write code, especially in the same language your colleagues use, can help build empathy and a better understanding of what happens after your mocks are finalized. As the line between &quot;designer&quot; and &quot;developer&quot; continues to blur, maybe the term &quot;builder&quot; is a nice middle ground.</em></li>
