This project is a playground for me to try new features and librairies.
It's a work in progress, features are being added regularly.

The App is made with React, Next.js, Vanilla Extract CSS and Zustand for state management. It stores data locally.

## how to use

Paste the RSS url of your favourite podcast in the input on top of the page to add it to your list.
